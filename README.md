# Telethreat

This game was made by [Matthew Bedder](http://bedder.co.uk) ([bedder](http://github.com/bedder)), [Christian Guckelsberger](http://ccg.doc.gold.ac.uk/christianguckelsberger/) ([cguckelsberger](http://github.com/cguckelsberger)), and [Nick Sephton](http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~nsephton/) ([tbigfish](http://github.com/tbigfish))for the first [IGGI](http://iggi.org.uk) Games Programming module at Goldsmiths, University of London.

The main chunk of code for this game was made over the course of a week, so is in a bit of a sorry state.

## Premise

(Christian is going to be ever so kind and write this bit)

## Controls

(Christian is also going to fill this in. I hope.)

## Unity 5 Port

This game has been ported to Unity 5.1 by Matthew Bedder, with this version being found on the aptly-named "[Unity 5](https://github.com/bedder/Telethreat/tree/Unity5)" branch. This variation has a revamped UI, has replaced the explosions with particle systems, has added particles to the chargers, has has generally better lighting and materials, and is slightly rebalanced.

It also probably has a load of bugs.

Web builds of this branch can be played [here for a Unity Webplayer version](http://bedder.co.uk/games/telethreat/play), and [here for a WebGL version](http://bedder.co.uk/games/telethreat/play/WebGl). The WebGL one is a bit buggy, but is largely playable.
